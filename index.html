			<p>There are several examples of ancient computing. The earlyiet known one is the summerian <a
					href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abacus">Abacus</a>. which kept count of
				items with stones on a wire. Another one is the <a
					href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antikythera_mechanism">Antikythera
					mechanism</a> which is thouht the be the works oldest geared computing device

					alt="Abacus"></p>
			<p>The Middle Ages saw several attempts at computing devices. Ramon Llull devoted a large part
				of his life to designing logical machines that, using undeniable truths, could produce
				all possible knowledge. They were never built and are mostly a though experiment. His
				work however influenced Gottfried Leibiniz, who built several calculating tools.</p>

		<div class="babbage">
			<h3>Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace</h3>
			<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8b/Babbage_Difference_Engine.jpg/250px-Babbage_Difference_Engine.jpg"
					alt="differance engine"></p>
			<p>the apex of early mechanical computing was the Difference Engine and Analytical Engine both
				made by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Babbage">Charles Babbage</a>.
				Although neither was made, a team of engineers built a functioning Difference Engine
				using only materials from the time. Babbage&#39;s devices could be reprogrammed with
				input on punch cards. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace">Ada
					Lovelace</a> wrote programs for these devices including one that calculated the
				Bernoulli numbers.</p>

					alt="Harvard Mark I"></p>
			<p>In the early 1900s, mechanical calculators like the <a
					href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comptometer">Comptometer</a> and the <a
					href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marchant_calculator">Marchant calculator</a>
				were widely used in business and science. During the 1930s, Konrad Zuse built the
				<strong>Z3</strong> in Germany, considered the first programmable electromechanical
				computer (1941). Around the same time, Howard Aiken and IBM developed the
				<strong>Harvard Mark I</strong>, a room-sized calculator used for U.S. Navy computations
				during World War II.

					alt="Alan Turing"></p>
			<p>In 1936, British mathematician <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing">Alan
					Turing</a> published a paper introducing the concept of a <strong>Turing
					machine</strong>, laying the foundation for theoretical computer science. During
				WWII, Turing worked at Bletchley Park to help break the German <strong>Enigma</strong>
				cipher, building machines like the <strong>Bombe</strong>, a pioneering code-breaking
				device.</p>

					alt="Colossus"></p>
			<p>Built in 1943–44, the <strong><a
						href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colossus_computer">Colossus</a></strong>
				was the world’s first programmable electronic digital computer. It was used by British
				codebreakers to decipher German teleprinter messages encrypted with the Lorenz cipher.
				Colossus significantly reduced the time required for decryption and remained secret for
				decades after the war.</p>

					alt="ENIAC"></p>
			<p>Developed at the University of Pennsylvania and completed in 1945, the <strong><a
						href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENIAC">ENIAC</a></strong> was the
				first fully electronic general-purpose computer. Created by <strong>John Presper
					Eckert</strong> and <strong>John Mauchly</strong>, it could solve a wide range
				of numerical problems, especially for military applications like artillery trajectory
				tables.</p>

			<h3>The Stored-Program Concept</h3>
			<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/JohnvonNeumann-LosAlamos.gif/250px-JohnvonNeumann-LosAlamos.gif"
					alt="John von Neumann"></p>
			<p>In 1945, <strong>John von Neumann</strong> proposed the <strong>stored-program
					architecture</strong>, which suggested that a computer’s program and data could
				be stored in the same memory. This model, later called the <strong>von Neumann
					architecture</strong>, became the standard for most computers. The first
				implementation of this idea was the <strong>EDVAC</strong>, followed by machines like
				<strong>EDSAC</strong> and <strong>Manchester Baby</strong>.

					alt="UNIVAC I"></p>
			<p>In 1951, <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNIVAC_I">UNIVAC I</a></strong>
				became the first commercial computer delivered in the United States. Also developed by
				Eckert and Mauchly, it was used by government and business clients and famously
				predicted the outcome of the 1952 U.S. presidential election live on television.</p>

					alt="Intel 4004"></p>
			<p>In the late 1950s and 1960s, engineers like <strong>Jack Kilby</strong> and <strong>Robert
					Noyce</strong> developed the <strong><a
						href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit">integrated
						circuit</a></strong> (IC), allowing many transistors to be placed on a
				single chip. In 1971, <strong>Intel</strong> introduced the <strong><a
						href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_4004">4004</a></strong>, the
				first commercial <strong>microprocessor</strong>, launching the era of general-purpose
				computing on a single chip.</p>

					alt="Altair 8800"></p>
			<p>In 1975, the <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altair_8800">Altair
						8800</a></strong>, often considered the first personal computer, was
				released as a kit. It inspired <strong>Bill Gates</strong> and <strong>Paul
					Allen</strong> to write a version of BASIC for it, founding
				<strong>Microsoft</strong>. Soon after, <strong>Apple Computer</strong> was formed by
				<strong>Steve Jobs</strong> and <strong>Steve Wozniak</strong>, leading to the 1977
				release of the <strong>Apple II</strong>, one of the first highly successful personal
				computers.

					alt="Xerox Alto"></p>
			<p>The <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xerox_Alto">Xerox Alto</a></strong> (1973)
				was the first computer with a <strong>graphical user interface (GUI)</strong>, using
				windows, icons, and a mouse. Though not commercially released, it influenced later
				systems. In 1984, Apple introduced the <strong>Macintosh</strong>, bringing the GUI and
				mouse to the mass market and changing how users interacted with computers.</p>

			<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d1/WWW-LetShare.svg/250px-WWW-LetShare.svg.png"
					alt="World Wide Web"></p>
			<p>While the <strong>Internet</strong> originated in the 1960s as <strong>ARPANET</strong>, it
				was the 1990 invention of the <strong><a
						href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">World Wide
						Web</a></strong> by <strong>Tim Berners-Lee</strong> that made the
				internet accessible to the public. By the mid-1990s, web browsers like
				<strong>Netscape</strong> and <strong>Internet Explorer</strong> helped drive an
				internet boom that reshaped global communication, commerce, and culture.

					alt="iPhone"></p>
			<p>The 2000s saw computing become portable and personal. <strong>Laptops</strong> became
				widespread, and in 2007, Apple released the first <strong><a
						href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_\(1st_generation\">iPhone</a>)</strong>,

			<p>Advances in hardware and algorithms have led to a boom in <strong>artificial intelligence
					(AI)</strong>. Systems like <strong>IBM Watson</strong>,
				<strong>AlphaGo</strong>, and most recently <strong>ChatGPT</strong> have demonstrated
